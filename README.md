# SBA-318

This project is a small Node and Express server application created for a take-home assessment. It demonstrates the use of Node.js, Express.js, and related technologies to build a RESTful API, manage middleware, and interact with the API through dynamically rendered views using a template engine.

The project includes core functionality such as data management, dynamic filtering, and CRUD operations, with creative freedom in the application's topic and content.
